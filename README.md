# Java-Guessing-Number-Game
How It Works:
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The player inputs guesses.
The program gives feedback:
"Too low!" if the guess is less than the number.
"Too high!" if the guess is greater than the number.
The loop continues until the player guesses the correct number.
When guessed correctly, the program congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts.
